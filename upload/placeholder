I had the same problem a few days ago on Fedora Linux but was able to resolve by modifying the SELinux setting for the "data" directory in my website. I got the solution from here (https://www.svnlabs.com/blogs/centos-7-selinux-apache-php-writeaccess-permission/).

I only needed these two commands to get the upload to work on the data folder inside the my website:
sudo chown apache:apache -R /data
sudo chcon -Rv --type=httpd_sys_rw_content_t data/

CentOS 7 + SELinux + Apache + PHP write/access permission
CentOS 7 have SELinux, it is security enhancement to Linux which allows users more control over access control.

SELinux make problem to access or write files or directories

- Can't serve files on directory
- Can't write to file

SELinux is blocking the read/write operations

# chcon -Rv --type=httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/ (if you want to allow full web root)

# chcon -Rv --type=httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/uploads/ (Or just uploads folder)

Ownership
# chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html/

Recursive File permissions
# find . -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;

Recursive Directory permissions
# find . -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;

Resursive SELinux serve files off Apache
# chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/ -R

Allow write to specific directories
# chcon -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/logs/ -R
# chcon -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/uploads/ -R

httpd_sys_content_t - allow Apache to serve contents
httpd_sys_rw_content_t - allow Apache to write to those path.
